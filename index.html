              As community members we ask what can people involved with the criminal justice system do to reduce the impact of debt on their lives when they return to the community after incarceration?<br><br>This resource can be used as a guide to
              organize and simplify the complicated task of navigating the criminal justice system.<br><br>And, it can also function as a
              checklist of tasks people can prioritize before, during, and after incarceration to reduce the impact of debt in their lives.<br><br>While we acknowledge there is no “clear solution” to the problems presented by the criminal justice
              system.<br><br>Hopefully this guide can be of help in dealing with the repercussions of an unjust system.

            After release, there are things you can do to <span class="highlight">manage and lessen the impact of any debts</span> you have as you are moving on with your life in the community. You can also look at this helpful guide created by
            the <a href=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/are-there-laws-that-limit-what-debt-collectors-can-say-or-do-en-329/#:~:text=The%20Fair%20Debt%20Collection%20Practices%20Act%20(FDCPA)%20is%20the%20main,to>

              <div class="storiescolumn">

                In the months after his release, Alejandro was making considerable <span class="highlight">headway towards greater stability</span>, helped by a full-time job as a valet parking attendant.<br><br>
                Because he was living in his sister’s apartment, he was able to <span class="highlight">save some money</span>, as he made plans to get his own place and hopefully purchase a car, which would allow him to <span class="highlight">find
                  a better job</span>.<br><br>
                Yet, the closer he got to his goals, the more of a <span class="highlight">financial mess</span> he seemed to be in.<br><br>
                Before he could buy a car, Alejandro had first to <span class="highlight">recover his license</span>, for which he had to pay <span class="highlight">various unpaid parking tickets and DMV fees</span>.

              </div>
              <div class="storiescolumn">


                To be able to get a car loan one day, he would need a <span class="highlight">higher credit score</span>. Improving his score, in turn, required <span class="highlight">paying off the utility and other debts he owed, such as child
                  support, a bank overdraft and back taxes.<br><br>
                </span> As these<span class="highlight">financial barriers to achieving his goals</span> kept coming up, Alejandro’s <span class="highlight">mental health suffered</span>, as did his relationship with his sister, and he found it
                increasingly <span class="highlight">difficult to maintain his sobriety</span>.

            Even if you weren’t able to take steps to put your finances in order before incarceration, there are <span class="highlight">things you can do from prison</span> to make sure that you aren’t overwhelmed with financial problems when you get out.

    About one year after his release, Carlos was still struggling to make ends meet: he and his wife were working <span class="highlight">minimum-wage jobs with irregular and unpredictable hours</span>, while caring for three young
    children.<br><br>
    When he was finally offered a full-time position at a landscaping company, Carlos figured he needed a mobile phone, but found that he could not get one due to several hundred dollars he owed to a cable company, <span class="highlight">for
      bills incurred while he was in prison</span>.

  </div>
  <div class="storiescolumn">


    Around the same time, Carlos realized he also had <span class="highlight">another debt he knew nothing about</span>, $900 to the electric company. Realizing he must have been <span class="highlight">a victim of identity theft</span>,
    Carlos made a report to the police department.<br><br>
    There he was told it would likely take months to solve the issue, and Carlos needed the phone now.<br><br>
    He had no choice but to pay the bill himself, <span class="highlight">further straining his household finances</span>.

            Getting arrested and sentenced can be a distressing, chaotic time, and it can be difficult to put your finances in order before being incarcerated. But there are some <span class="highlight">things you can do to reduce the financial
              problems you might face</span> when you are released.

    When Shanice was arrested, the last thing she thought to do was <span class="highlight">call the electric company to cancel service</span> at her one-bedroom apartment, which she shared with her boyfriend. It wasn’t easy to do from
    the local jail even if she had wanted to: phone access was limited and calls extremely costly.
    <br><br>
    Also, her boyfriend was still living in the apartment, and Shanice saw no reason to let him go without lights.
    <br><br>
    Shanice also didn’t think about her bank account – she just hoped she’d have some money left in it when she came out.
<br><br>
    After release, Shanice’s decisions came back to haunt her.

  </div>
  <div class="storiescolumn">


    Her ex-boyfriend had ‘run’ with her electric account for as long as he could until the lights were shut off, <span class="highlight">leaving the balance unpaid</span>.
    <br><br>
    When Shanice came out of prison, her bank account had gone overdrawn due to monthly fees and the bank had closed it, <span class="highlight">her credit was ruined</span>, and the <span class="highlight">utility company wouldn’t open
      a new account</span> until she paid the arrears, making it <span class="highlight">impossible for her to find a landlord</span> in the city who would take her housing voucher.

            When you return to the community from prison, you may have to deal with debts and being behind on bills, which can be stressful and get in the way of successful reentry. People who are incarcerated often have debts even before they go
            to prison, and those debts can get worse, and additional debts pile up, while a person is in prison, and as they deal with the reentry process after release.

              Much change is needed to create a more just and equitable criminal justice system and financial services industry, to prevent people getting into debt and experiencing financial and credit difficulties related to
              incarceration.<br><br>Here are some policy changes necessary to reform the current system in Connecticut.<br>
              <ul>
                <li>Stop CT DOC charging people for their incarceration.</li>
                <li>Decrease direct costs of incarceration such as bail and phone calls (CT Bail Fund; CT House Bill 6714).</li>
                <li>Automate child support freeze for people with sentences longer than 3 months.</li>
                <li>Provide free, no-fee basic bank accounts for all.</li>
                <li>Provide guidance and funds to help pay off debts and fix credit, such as FinEquity in New York.</li>
                <li>Simplify and reduce cost of ID retrieval process.</li>
                <li>Create a trusted Power-of-Attorney service for people who don’t have someone they can trust to manage their finances while they are incarcerated.</li>
              </ul>
